                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>I am Muhammad Al-Sarraf, a self taught freelance programmer. Mainly doing back-end, I specialise in lots of scopes, from software engineering to web development, and even discord bots.</p>

                        <h2>Website development</h2>
                        <p>Website development (or "web dev") is the first thing I learned to do. It is an important aspect that allows me to make websites freely, just the way I want them to be. This has led to me being able to create this personal website so to share my knowledge and increase my chances as a freelancer.</p>

                        <p>Game dev is another big part of programming, because it is pretty protifable with the amount of people gaming these days. It is the second thing I learned to do and love to do it. The thrill of playing your own game is uncomparable.<br>The only setbacks you'll see in me are: <br><br> 1- I can only make 2D games. <br> 2- I cannot provide the sprites for the game. <br><br> And if you're thinking that mentioning my weak points isn't a good idea, honesty is a key to success, and I hope these will not affect you're requests, if you have any, much.</p>

                        <h2>Discord bots</h2>
                        <p>Making discord bots is always a thrill, no matter what language you're making them on, especially if it's a bot for a certain task that involves things other than Discord, usually game APIs. If you want to see how I develop my discord bots you can join my discord bot test server, or you can go to the <a href="#projects">projects</a> page and look at which bot interests you the most.</p>

                        <h2>Back-end development</h2>
                        <p>Since I develop websites, the most important two aspects to know are back-end and front-end. To be honest, I am pretty bad at front-end, so I decided to focus more on back-end, using mostly JavaScript and PHP. Back-end allows me to manage the server side of the website, like setting up account creation and cyber security.</p>

                            <p>MoJh is the first discord bot I made. It is a moderation bot made with Java. Its original plan was to be a "Clash of Clans" bot but I thought that I should start simple with no APIs as it was the first.</p>
