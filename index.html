                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is Muhammad Al-Sarraf, and I'm a self-taught freelance programmer with a strong passion for building functional, efficient, and scalable software solutions. While my primary focus lies in back-end development, my skill set spans across a wide range of areas including software engineering, web development, and automationâ€”particularly through custom Discord bots. <br><br> Over the years, I've honed my abilities through hands-on projects, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Whether it's designing robust APIs, managing databases, or crafting seamless user experiences from the server side, I bring dedication and adaptability to every project I take on. My freelance journey has allowed me to collaborate with diverse clients and tackle a variety of technical challenges, helping me grow not only as a developer but also as a creative problem-solver.</p>

                        <h2>Website development</h2>
                        <p>Website development (often referred to as "web dev") was the very first skill I learned to master. From the very beginning, I found it to be an incredibly rewarding field, as it gave me the ability to build and design websites exactly the way I envisioned them. Learning web development has not only allowed me to create fully customized websites, but it has also given me the flexibility to experiment with various styles, technologies, and features that make a site unique and functional. Over time, this expertise has empowered me to bring my personal projects to life, such as this very website. By sharing my knowledge through this platform, I aim to not only showcase my skills and experiences but also connect with others in the industry. Ultimately, this website serves as a key part of my journey as a freelancer, helping me expand my reach, increase my professional opportunities, and grow my network within the web development community.</p>

                        <p>Game development is another key area of programming, and it's incredibly profitable given the popularity of gaming today. It was the second skill I learned, and I quickly grew to love it. There's something unmatched about the thrill of playing your own game after all the work you've put into it. The process of creating a game is both challenging and rewarding, and it's always exciting to see others enjoy something you built.<br>The only setbacks you'll see in me are: <br><br> 1- I can only make 2D games. <br> 2- I cannot provide the sprites for the game.</p>

                        <h2>Discord bots</h2>
                        <p>Creating Discord bots is always an exciting experience for me, no matter which programming language I'm using. The real thrill comes when the bot serves a specific purpose, especially if it involves integrating with external systems, like game APIs. This adds an extra layer of functionality and makes the development process even more engaging. Whether it's automating tasks, enhancing user experience, or adding unique features, there's always something new to explore. If you're interested in seeing how I develop my Discord bots, feel free to join my Discord bot test server where you can see them in action. Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="#projects">projects section</a> to check out the bots I've worked on and see which one interests you the most.</p>

                        <h2>Back-end development</h2>
                        <p>Since I specialize in website development, the two most important aspects to understand are back-end and front-end development. While both are crucial for building fully functional websites, I've realized that I'm not as strong with front-end development. Because of this, I decided to focus more on the back-end, where I can really dive into the server-side processes. I primarily work with JavaScript and PHP, which allow me to manage things like database interactions, server configurations, and user authentication. Back-end development is essential for tasks such as setting up account creation, managing user data securely, and ensuring robust cyber security. It's the foundation that keeps the website running smoothly behind the scenes, and I find that to be where my skills truly shine.</p>

                            <p>MoJh is the first Discord bot I ever created, built using Java. It started out as a simple moderation bot with basic features like muting, kicking, and banning users. Originally, I planned for it to be a Clash of Clans bot using external APIs, but since it was my first project, I decided to keep things simple and focus on core functionality first. <br><br> Working on MoJh helped me learn the fundamentals of bot development, event handling, and command systems. It was a great starting point that laid the groundwork for more complex projects later on.</p>
